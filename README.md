# Tracker Modifier

This script modifies the tracker address in your torrents. 

This is useful in the event that a tracker you use moves to a new address. 


## Attention!

This script currently only works on Windows with the Deluge client.

It may work with other operating systems / torrent clients in the future, but it's not a priority for me. 


## Instructions

Make sure you have Ruby installed first! 

Run the script from the command line with "ruby tracker_modifier.rb" and answer the questions it asks you. 

Done! Enjoy :]
